Bayesian Optimization (BO) – Ongoing Special Study 
This project explores Bayesian Optimization (BO) — a powerful method for optimizing black-box functions where the objective function is unknown and costly to evaluate. BO is particularly useful when each evaluation of the function is time-consuming, computationally expensive, or monetarily constrained. It stands apart from traditional methods like grid search or random search by building a surrogate model (typically a Gaussian Process) to approximate the function based on past observations. Using an acquisition function, such as expected improvement, BO smartly decides where to evaluate next by balancing exploration (uncertain regions) and exploitation (known promising regions). This makes BO highly effective in areas requiring efficient optimization strategies.
