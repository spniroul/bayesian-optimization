<h1>Bayesian Optimization (BO) – Ongoing Special Study</h1>

<p>
  This project explores <strong>Bayesian Optimization (BO)</strong> — a powerful method for optimizing black-box functions where the objective function is unknown and costly to evaluate. 
  BO is particularly useful when each evaluation of the function is time-consuming, computationally expensive, or monetarily constrained.
  It stands apart from traditional methods like grid search or random search by building a <em>surrogate model</em> (typically a Gaussian Process) 
  to approximate the function based on past observations. Using an <em>acquisition function</em>, such as <strong>expected improvement</strong>, 
  BO smartly decides where to evaluate next by balancing <strong>exploration</strong> (uncertain regions) and <strong>exploitation</strong> (known promising regions).
  This makes BO highly effective in areas requiring efficient optimization strategies.
